# ESP32-CAN-X2 upstream references

## CAN bridge example

The Arduino sketch `arduino/CAN Forward/can_demo_forward.ino` published by
Autosport Labs demonstrates a bidirectional bridge between the ESP32's native
TWAI controller and an external MCP2515. The excerpt below confirms that the
board routes the TWAI interface to `GPIO_NUM_6` (RX) and `GPIO_NUM_7` (TX):

```
// CAN1 (TWAI) Pins
#define CAN1_RX_PIN GPIO_NUM_6
#define CAN1_TX_PIN GPIO_NUM_7
```

The same example places the MCP2515 on the HSPI bus (SCK `GPIO12`, MISO `GPIO13`,
MOSI `GPIO11`, chip select `GPIO10`) and forwards every frame it receives on
both CAN networks.

## UART connector

Autosport Labs clarified (via their support channels and GitHub discussions)
that the UART pads on the CAN-X2 header are wired to `GPIO37` for TX and
`GPIO36` for RX. The TinyBMS gateway now defaults to those pins so the
pre-crimped Autosport Labs harness can be connected directly to the TinyBMS
serial port and exposes them in both `idf.py menuconfig` and the web
configuration form for quick remapping when custom wiring looms are used.
